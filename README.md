# NumberGame
The NumberGame is a small game developed by me where the computer generates a number with in a range and the user get prompted to guess the number with in 3 chances 
then the computer tells if the entered number matches the guess number or it is higher/lower than the computer generated number the game continous untill the user want to quit.
